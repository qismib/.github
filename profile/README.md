# QISMIB: Quatum Information Science Milano-Bicocca

</div>

<p align="justify"> The primary mission of the Quantum Information Science Milano-Bicocca (QISMIB) initiative at the University of Milano-Bicocca is to introduce undergraduate and master students to the main foundational concepts of quantum computing and quantum technologies, as well as to provide them with the necessary theoretical and experimental tools to pursue research in this field. Additionally, the initiative aims to promote the advancement of quantum technologies through cutting-edge research projects, by fostering collaboration and knowledge exchange within the academic community. Through the implementation of cutting-edge research projects, QISMIB aims to train a new generation of highly qualified professionals with a strong background in quantum information science, who will be able to contribute to the advancement of this field and to the development of new quantum technologies.    
  
If you are interested in quantum computing and quantum technologies and would like to carry on your thesis with our group please contact us at the email address: [andrea.giachero at mib.infn.it](mailto:andrea.giachero@mib.infn.it)  
  
The key tenets of the proposed thesis are centered around the cutting-edge fields of Quantum Simulation, Quantum Machine Learning, Quantum Key Distribution, and the Design and Simulation of qubits. These areas of study represent the vanguard of quantum technology research, offering a wealth of opportunities for exploration and innovation. From the use of quantum systems to simulate complex physical phenomena, to the application of machine learning algorithms to optimize quantum algorithms, to the development of secure communication protocols using quantum key distribution, and the design and simulation of qubits that are crucial building blocks of quantum computing, the proposed thesis delves into the very forefront of this rapidly evolving field. More details are illustrated in the below sections.
  
QISMIB initiative is part of the Bicocca Quantum Technologies Centre (BiQuTe), more information are available at [biqute.unimib.it](https://biqute.unimib.it/)

## Quantum Simulation

## Quantum Machine Learning

## Quantum Key Distribution
<p align="justify"> Quantum key distribution (QKD) is a method for secure communication that uses the principles of quantum mechanics to establish a secret key between two parties. This key can then be used to encrypt and decrypt messages, ensuring that only the intended recipients can read them. The BB84 and E91 protocols are well-established examples of QKD protocols that have been proposed and implemented, while the Continuous-variable (CV-QKD) and Measurement-Device-Independent (CV-MDI) protocols are relatively newer but promising candidates that offer immunity to side-channel attacks. The security and performance of these protocols can be evaluated by analyzing the different types of attacks that can be performed by an eavesdropper. To further enhance the evaluation, numerical simulations can be conducted, taking into account different scenarios and noise models. Additionally, exploring novel techniques for error correction and the use of novel quantum states can be considered as potential avenues for future research.

## Design and Simulation of qubits
<p align="justify"> One of the main problems that the quantum research community is facing at the moment is "how do we actually build an error resistant, multi-purpose quantum computer?". One way to do that is using superconducting qubits. 
Our group is working on superconducting qubit design for multiple applications: quantum sensors, quantum computers and other devices. The main challenges will be to improve current designs and find new ones in order to build better qubits for all applications. 
The qubit design process goes through different steps: ideation and parameter definition, design, electromagnetic simulation and quantum parameters extraction.
The first phase can be faced by simulating quantum systems using libraries such as <a href="https://qutip.org/">Qutip</a> and <a href="https://scqubits.readthedocs.io/en/latest/">Scqubits</a> . These libraries offer a simple framework to simulate numerically qubit and other quantum systems. In this way we can define our goals for the final system to be designed. 
Once our objectives are set, we design qubits using <a href="https://qiskit.org/metal/">Qiskit-Metal</a> (IBM) and the Qubit Simulation Module (QSM, developed at NIST). To evaluate the qubit parameters from the design we use different simulations: the Energy Participation Ratio (<a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41534-021-00461-8">EPR</a>) and the Lumped Oscillator Model (<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2103.10344">LOM</a>). Both these analyses exploits ANSYS (HFSS and Q3D) to perform electromagnetic simulations. The results of the EM software are then used to quantize the system and extract all the interesting parameters. The design will be then modified until these parameters match the goals we set. With this workflow we tune each device to better suit its specific application. </p>
